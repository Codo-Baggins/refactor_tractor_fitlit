# DTR Memo

## Project: Refactor Tractor - FitLit

### Group Member Names:

* Joe Lopez
* JP Carey
* Jordon Smith

### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

* `JP`: Have a solid understanding of using asynchronous JS. Want to understand how to use Webpack. Be at least an equal contributor.
* `Jordon`: Gain a better understanding of APIs and how they work. Knowing where and how to refactor pieces of code and why they need to be refactored.
* `Joe`: Better understanding of asynchronous JS and fetching and posting data on an API. Strengthen identifying refactoring opportunities.
* `As a team:` We want to experience the major learning goals like Webpack, Sass, fetching APIS, and Chai Spies for DOM and for that want to do paired programming. That said, we want to identify areas where it will be more efficient to divide and conquer (only if it's busy work). We want to make good use of Github issues. We'll know we're successful if we can all speak to the code that's in our program, and if we're feeling confident going into our final projects.

### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

* `JP`:  Effective communicator, and extremely motivated. I like paired programming but also sometimes need to touch the code when we're stuck so will likely pull down current work to try to help solve things when we're stuck.
* `Jordon`: Being open minded and straightforward. If I'm ever driving, please feel free to navigate for me if you have an idea. Sometimes when I am facing a problem, I want to get it on my computer and mess with it myself.
* `Joe`: Be blunt and critical with me, when you want something to change and I will do the same for you - open communication.

### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

It seems like we have a few strengths in common - honest and open communicators, we like to get our hands on code even if we're not going to be making commits.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?:

* `Joe` - Early riser.  only restrictions are dinner and Sunday football. Need to set aside more time for JS Fun.
* `JP` - I do JS fun before class and cut off working at 10PM usually.
* `Jordon` - Don't like working super late (10PM suggested).

If we feel good about the status of our project we can take take a night or two off during the weekend. This is fluid and may changed after fully planning out the project.

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

We're taking down each others phone numbers to communicate outside of Slack, but we will also use Slack during the day as needed.  Make decisions as a team by consensus. We'll let each other know if something is wrong, but otherwise you can assume everything is fine!

### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

`JP` - DOM manipulation and event delegation are primary strengths. I want to improve knowing when to use reduce vs forEach. I want be proactive about learning API fetches.

`Jordon ` -  Strength in picking up things quickly and understanding them. Want to improve at event delegation.

`Joe` - Methodical approach to solving problems - console.logging, returning, and where things need to go + how they need to fit together. Event delegation is an area of improvement and so are iterator methods.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Utilize Github issues with Github Project Boards, and proactively updating it. Try out both Zoom and Tuple and see which works best for us.

### Pomodoro Break Schedule:

45 minutes on and 5 or 10 off.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Be honest, we're expecting it.
