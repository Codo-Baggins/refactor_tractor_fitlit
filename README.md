## Project Description
Refactor Tractor Fitlit is an application that stores fitness and health data for multiple users.  The data that is tracked includes hydration, physical activity, and sleep data for the both the individual user and even their close friends. Other pertinent data specific to each user such as name, address, email, and even fitness goal information are all tracked as well, giving each user their own unique profile. In addition, data can be dynamically updated via three separate forms at the top of the application.   

## Set Up Instructions

- Clone down this repo by running `git clone git@github.com:Codo-Baggins/refactor_tractor_fitlit.git` in your terminal
- `cd` into the directory
- Run `npm start` in the terminal 
- You will be greeted with a message that includes a url that will follow the following format: "Project is running at `http://localhost:8080/`"
- Copy the entire url into your browser search bar

## Learning Goals
- Develop and enhance our understanding of:
  - APIs
  - Asynchronous JS
  - Testing the DOM
  - Webpack
  - SCSS
## Programming Languages And Other Tools Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS
- NPM 
- Chai
- Mocha
- Webpack

## Planning
- [DTR](https://github.com/Codo-Baggins/refactor_tractor_fitlit/blob/main/planning/DTR.md)
- [Project Board](https://github.com/Codo-Baggins/refactor_tractor_fitlit/projects/1)

## Challenges
- Inheriting and refactoring an incomplete/messy codebase 
- Working with an API that was being used by the entire cohort (incorrectly formatted data being posted by other groups)
- Understanding the scope and direction of the original project
- Using Chai spies to test the DOM

## Wins
- Code is readable, easy to follow, and significantly more dynamic than the original codebase
- We have a working application that can fetch data properly from multiple APIS
- The application is well formatted and makes use of ARIA principles
- Proper use of partial files, mixins, variables, and inheritance in our scss files
- Made good use of parent classes
- Learned a decent amount about Webpack and how it works
